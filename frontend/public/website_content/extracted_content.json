  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can solar panels work on cloudy or rainy days?",
      "answer": "Yes, solar panels still generate electricity on cloudy days, though their efficiency may be reduced. Modern solar panels are designed to capture sunlight even in low-light conditions. Solar systems generate power close to where it is consumed, minimizing energy loss from long-distance grid transmission. Solar panels can be installed in urban, rural, and remote areas, making solar energy accessible to a wide range of users."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the lifespan of a solar panel?",
      "answer": "Solar panels are designed to last for a significant period, typically between 25 and 30 years. While they may continue to function beyond this timeframe, their energy production efficiency will gradually decrease."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do solar panels require a lot of maintenance?",
      "answer": "Solar panels generally require very little maintenance. They are designed to be low-maintenance, with no moving parts to wear out. The primary maintenance involves occasional cleaning to remove dirt, dust, or debris that can obstruct sunlight. In some cases, inspections may be recommended to check for any damage or loose connections, especially in areas with heavy pollution or frequent storms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can solar panels power my entire home?",
      "answer": "Yes, it is possible to power your entire home with solar panels, but it often requires a well-designed system with battery storage and careful energy management. While solar panels generate electricity from sunlight, they only produce power when the sun is shining, making battery storage crucial for consistent power, especially at night and during cloudy days"
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time we get backup from solar panels?",
      "answer": "The backup time provided by solar panels with battery storage depends on several factors, including the battery's capacity, the amount of electricity used, and the intensity of sunlight. Generally, a solar battery system for a home can provide backup power for a few hours to a few days"
