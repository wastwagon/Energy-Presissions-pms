## How to Create a Competitive Counter-Quote

### Step 1: Recreate the Customer & Project

1. **Create Customer**:
   - Name: Kofi Oppong
   - Phone: +447404919168
   - Address: Agbogba
   - Email: (if available)

2. **Create Project**:
   - Project Name: "Solaris Power System - Standard Load"
   - Location: Agbogba
   - System Type: Hybrid/Off-Grid (since they have batteries)

3. **Add Appliances** (from competitor's invoice):
   - Lighting (Outside): 15W × 15 units × 12 hrs/day × 7 days/wk
   - Lighting (Interior): 15W × 20 units × 5 hrs/day × 7 days/wk
   - Fans: 70W × 5 units × 10 hrs/day × 7 days/wk
   - TV: 100W × 1 unit × 5 hrs/day × 7 days/wk
   - Fridge: 120W × 2 units × 10 hrs/day × 7 days/wk
   - Other Loads: 1,500W × 1 unit × 4 hrs/day × 7 days/wk

### Step 2: Run Sizing Calculation

The system will automatically calculate:
- Accurate daily energy requirement
- Optimal number of panels (may differ from competitor's 10)
- Proper inverter sizing with DC/AC ratio
- Battery capacity if backup hours specified
- System efficiency and design factors

**Key Advantage**: Your system will show WHY these numbers were chosen, not just the numbers.

### Step 3: Configure Products & Pricing

1. **Add Products to Catalog**:
   - Panels: Jinko 580W, Longi 570W, or JA 560W
   - Inverter: Match or exceed competitor's capacity
   - Batteries: Modern lithium (LiFePO4) vs their "deep cycle" (likely lead-acid)
   - Mounting, BOS, Installation, Transport

2. **Pricing Strategy**:
   - **Option A - Match Price**: Price competitively at ~114,000 GHS but show MORE value
   - **Option B - Premium Pricing**: Price slightly higher but emphasize superior engineering and modern components
   - **Option C - Aggressive Pricing**: Price lower (e.g., 105,000-110,000 GHS) to win the deal

### Step 4: Generate Quote with Enhanced PDF

The new PDF template now includes:
- ✅ **System Specifications Section** showing:
  - Total daily energy requirement
  - Effective daily energy (after losses)
  - Monthly energy generation
  - Peak sun hours for location
  - PV array capacity breakdown
  - Panel brand and model
  - Inverter capacity
  - DC/AC ratio (optimized)
  - Battery capacity (if applicable)
  - Required roof area
  - System efficiency percentage
  - Engineering notes explaining the calculations

### Step 5: Add Competitive Notes

In the quote's "Notes" or "Payment Terms" section, highlight:

```
